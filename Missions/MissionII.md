# Git branch

Welcome to Mission II
You will learn how to deal with branch here

Since you come here with the command `git checkout MissionII`
The `MissionII` is the name of this branch

Generally, if you work on a small project, you can easily manage your code
"I'm fixing bug in main.java! dont touch it"
You can orally lock the file, git is more a file server to you

That's ok!



But in a large project suchas [d3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3)
It's difficult to manage code in tradition way

So there is a concept __branch__ in git
Just like a tree, there is a main branch call __master__

When you want to add a module to the project
You could __checkout__ a branch from __master__
And make your own changes in your branch

After you finish your work
You should __merge__ your branch to __master__
During the __merge__ you should also fix the conflicts
(Such as you add a eat_bamboo function
but others change ANIMAL_PANDA to ANIMAL_TIGER) (lol)

So let's try it again:

type
`
    git checkout MissionIII
`

to start further journey!

GL HF!
